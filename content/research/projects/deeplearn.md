#### Biologically-informed deep neural networks (new)

Rapidly growing biological data often requires a development of novel computational algorithms. 
Ideally, such algorithms would accurately classify biological states, while providing insights into functionality of complex biological systems.
Deep learning algorithms are recently emerging as an attractive choice.
Despite their high-accuracy in distinguish biological states (ex: pathological images of cancer vs healthy counterparts), 
deep learning methods, however, tend to use large volumes of raw and often redundant data.
Consequently, such algorithms require vast computational resources, take long time to execute and it is often hard to understand what data contributes to the obtained results and thus the biological interpretability is lost.  

#
##### Methods
Creating AI algorithms that can work with meaningfully selected biological data to efficiently provide both accurate and understandable/interpretable results is thus very desirable.
In particular we are interested in understanding how immune cells develop and function in selected diseases, what genomic regions and regulators control those processes and how they would potentially respond to perturbations.

For that we want to use a variety of NGS data (sc-RNAseq/RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C, etc.) at a sequence and count level, genomic regions annotations and databases of biological pathways to construct neural network that can highlight what genes/DNA elements are responsible for underlying biological phenomena.

##### Recruitment
We are looking for [JSPS Postdocs](../../../recruitment/postdoc-jsps) interested in working at intersection of cancer/immunology and deep-learning. Biology knowledge would be beneficial, but it is not strictly required. **If interested, please [email us](mailto:jordanr@yokohama-cu.ac.jp).**
