#### Understanding pathology of COVID-19 using NGS and clinical data 
Since the initial outbreak in December 2019, COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 500 million infections worldwide while claiming more than 6 million lives (as of April 2022). Despite that a large majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) display only mild disease symptoms, it remains to be determined why others become critically, or even terminally, ill. 

Extensive research dedicated to understanding COVID-19 disease pathology have established that disease in critical patients is accompanied by: 
- excessive infiltration of monocytes, macrophages and T cells. 
- systematic cytokine storm  
- pulmonary oedema and pneumonia 
- widespread inflammation and multi-organ damage 

Despite commonly observed immune dysregulation characteristic to critical COVID-19 patients, molecular mechanisms controlling disease progression and its outcome still remain unclear.

#### Methods
By using own and public scRNA-seq we try to understand roles of various immune cells and the underlying changes in their gene expression programs during COVID-19 disease. In particular, we want to elucidate how the transcription factors (TFs) downstream of the viral endosomal and cytoplasmic RNA sensors and their targets work with a main goal to develop safe and effective therapeutics. 
We also use proteomics, lipidomics and clinical data to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19 severity.
