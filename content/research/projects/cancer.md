#### Understanding molecular mechanisms of pancreatic cancers

Pancreas is the abdominal organ situated behind the lower part of the stomach responsible for releasing digestive enzymes and producing hormones regulating blood sugar levels.
As early pancreatic cancers generally show no symptoms, they can grow very large or spread outside the pancreas before being detected. 
Consequently, pancreatic cancers have a very poor prognosis and are one of the most lethal cancers:
25% of people survive one year while only 5% survive for five years.

#
#### Methods 
We use public and own NGS data (scRNA-seq/RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.) from cancer patients and mouse models to better understand key genes and molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancers. In particular, we are looking into connecting the disease onset and progression to immune cells make-up and state.     

#
#### Recruitment
We are looking for [JSPS Postdocs](../../../recruitment/postdoc-jsps/) in: AI (deep-learning) and Bioinformatics interested in cancer research. Biology knowledge would be beneficial, but it is not strictly required. **If interested, please [email us](mailto:jordanr@yokohama-cu.ac.jp).**
