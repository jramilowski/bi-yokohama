#### 3D genome structure and lncRNAs in myeloid cells differentiation
Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) play very important roles in controlling both innate and adaptive immunity. Under normal conditions, cDCs originate in bone marrow from Common Dendritic Progenitors (CDPs). 
IRF8 is one of the key transcription factors regulating differentiation of cDCs into cDC1 and cDC2 cell subsets. 
Surprisingly, cDC2s are also found in lacking CDPs Irf8-deficient mice, suggesting that cDC2s can possibly originate from “hidden” progenitors and/or from existing progenitors through previously unobserved developmental transitions. 

#
#### Methods
In-depth studies to elucidate this important alternative mechanism of cDC2s generation are still lacking.
Using a variety of bulk (Hi-C/Tiled-C, ATAC-seq) and single-cell (CITE-seq) NGS data we are looking into investigate a detailed mechanism of generating cDC2s in-vivo in the absence of IRF8 and CDPs. In particulate we aim to uncover: (i) unknown populations of cDC2 progenitors, (ii) novel developmental transitions, and (iii) underlying enhancer-Gene Regulatory Networks controlling the process, including lncRNAs and cell-cell communication.

#### Recruitment
We are looking for [JSPS Postdocs](../../../recruitment/postdoc-jsps/): AI (deep-learning), Bioinformatics, Experimental interested in working on 3D genome structure and lncRNAs in immune cells differentiation. Immunology knowledge would be beneficial, but it is not strictly required. **If interested, please [email us](mailto:jordanr@yokohama-cu.ac.jp).**
