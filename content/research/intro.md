Our projects are biologically-driven with the aim to understand biological processes at the molecular & cellular level, so to ultimately help cure diseases and enhance the human life. 
We use cutting-edge computational algorithms, pipelines and our high-spec [computational platform](../equipment) to analyze own and public NGS & clinical data.
**See also our** [papers](../papers).

#### Biology
- COVID-19 pathology & cancers
- immune cells differentiation &  gene regulation
- long non-coding RNAs, 3D genome structure, cellâ€“cell communication

#### Methods & Technologies
- statistics, ML, AI/deep-learning (starting)
- Linux, R, Python, nf-core pipelines
- RNA-seq, Hi-C, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, single cell data

#### Current Projects
1. [Understanding pathology of COVID-19 using NGS and clinical data](../projects/covid19) 
2. [3D genome structure and lncRNAs in myeloid cells differentiation](../projects/hic) 
3. [Pancreatic cancer: molecular mechanism of the disease](../projects/cancer) 
4. [Biologically-informed deep neural networks (new)](../projects/deeplearn)
5. Other collaborative projects
