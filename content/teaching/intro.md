All our *courses* are online and are open to YCU Students (free), Faculty Members, and to YCU Collaborators.  
[**Join our FY-2022 Courses!**](../courses)

#
#### ***01. Practical Bioinformatics** (English)

this course helps our medical students and experimental researchers to learn basic theoretical and practical aspects of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Data Analysis. 
Students learn to write, debug and execute simple and reproducible *R* codes using *RStudio* and perform most common NGS data functional analysis.  

#
#### ***02. Current Trends in Bioinformatics** (Japanese/English)

this course/seminar is conducted with help of other academic and industry researchers.
It shows current, primarily medical, applications of Bioinformatics and best practices in analyzing and exploring biological data by using state-of-the-art Bioinformatics and AI Algorithms. 
The course also provides networking opportunities.

***offered to YCU Graduate Student as an elective subject (選択講義)**

#
#### **03. Advanced Practical Bioinformatics** (English)

our advanced courses are particularly useful to those with more specific data analysis interests.
A given course aims to be a more in-depth coverage of one selected topic (ex: single cell data analysis). 
The course builds on previously acquired *R* programming skills, either independently or through our *practical bioinformatics courses*.
