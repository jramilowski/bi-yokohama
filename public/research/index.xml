      <description>Biologically-informed deep neural networks (new) Rapidly growing biological data often requires a development of novel computational algorithms. Ideally, such algorithms would accurately classify biological states, while providing insights into functionality of complex biological systems. Deep learning algorithms are recently emerging as an attractive choice. Despite their high-accuracy in distinguish biological states (ex: pathological images of cancer vs healthy counterparts), deep learning methods, however, tend to use large volumes of raw and often redundant data.</description>

      <description>3D genome structure and lncRNAs in myeloid cells differentiation Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) play very important roles in controlling both innate and adaptive immunity. Under normal conditions, cDCs originate in bone marrow from Common Dendritic Progenitors (CDPs). IRF8 is one of the key transcription factors regulating differentiation of cDCs into cDC1 and cDC2 cell subsets. Surprisingly, cDC2s are also found in lacking CDPs Irf8-deficient mice, suggesting that cDC2s can possibly originate from “hidden” progenitors and/or from existing progenitors through previously unobserved developmental transitions.</description>

      <description>Understanding pathology of COVID-19 using NGS and clinical data Since the initial outbreak in December 2019, COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 500 million infections worldwide while claiming more than 6 million lives (as of April 2022). Despite that a large majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) display only mild disease symptoms, it remains to be determined why others become critically, or even terminally, ill.
Extensive research dedicated to understanding COVID-19 disease pathology have established that disease in critical patients is accompanied by:</description>

      <description>Understanding molecular mechanisms of pancreatic cancers Pancreas is the abdominal organ situated behind the lower part of the stomach responsible for releasing digestive enzymes and producing hormones regulating blood sugar levels. As early pancreatic cancers generally show no symptoms, they can grow very large or spread outside the pancreas before being detected. Consequently, pancreatic cancers have a very poor prognosis and are one of the most lethal cancers: 25% of people survive one year while only 5% survive for five years.</description>

      <description>Our projects are biologically-driven with the aim to understand biological processes at the molecular &amp;amp; cellular level, so to ultimately help cure diseases and enhance the human life. We use cutting-edge computational algorithms, pipelines and our high-spec computational platform to analyze own and public NGS &amp;amp; clinical data. See also our papers.

      <description>We use programming languages (R, Python, shell), computational algorithms and nf-core pipelines to analyze a variety of NGS (RNA-seq, Hi-C, ChIP-seq/CUTnTag/CutnRUN, ATAC-seq, single-cell data, etc.) and clinical data. High-end Computational &amp;amp; LTO Tape System servers are installed onsite to efficiently analyze and store our data. Our sequencing platform includes 10x Chromium Controler and NextSeq 500 sequencer.
